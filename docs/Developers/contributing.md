# Contibuting

First and foremost; thank you for using BrayanBot. Regardless of whether or not you are a developer, you using BrayanBot means something to us. We thank you for your trust and continuous support.

## Contibuting to BrayanBot
If you are a developer who is using BrayanBot, consider contributing! Be it in the form of an addon or simply improvements to the codebase; we will appreciate any kinds of contributions coming our way.

If you are interested in creating your own addons, please take a look at [Creating your Own Addons](/addons/creating-your-own/) and if you would prefer using the template to create an entirely different bot; see [Using the Template](template/).

For direct contributions to the codebase, please take a look at [Contribution Guidelines]

If neither of those interest you, we also highly appreciate all Bug Reports and Feature requests over [Github Issues](/).
