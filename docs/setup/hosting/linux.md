<Tabs>

3. Copy the example config to the main `config.yml` 
```bash
cp example.config.yml config.yml # cp is a built-in Linux command for copying files
```
**or if you would like to simply rename the file**
```bash
mv example.config.yml config.yml # mv is a built-in Linux command for moving files
```
4. Edit your `config.yml`
```bash
nano config.yml
```
**or**
```bash
vim config.yml # Imagine using vim
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dev" label="Dev">

:::danger Dev Branch
If you are interested in receiving updates *as soon as they are out* for the cost of high chance of breaking changes and less stability; you may clone into the **dev** branch instead of **main**. Changes from the dev branch will be *eventually* merged into main, but it is an option for those who like to live on edge.
You also must keep in mind that using `git` will set up version control for your bot files and will make it harder to update if you have edited default -and tracked- bot files. **Do not** use this branch if you do not know how to use **git**.
:::

1. Clone the Github Repo
```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/BrayanBotDev/BrayanBot.git
```
2. Move into the BrayanBot Directory
```bash
cd BrayanBot
```
3. Copy the example config to the main `config.yml` 
```bash
cp example.config.yml config.yml 
```
**or if you would like to rename the file instead of copying**
```bash
mv example.config.yml config.yml
```
4. Edit your `config.yml`
```bash
nano config.yml
```
**or**
```bash
vim config.yml
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing NodeJS Dependencies & Starting BrayanBot
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
sudo npm i -g yarn
```
2. Install Required dependencies
```bash
yarn
```
3. Start the Bot
```bash
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And that's it, you have successfully started your bot!

## Power Controls
If you would like to keep the bot running after you log out of your terminal/machine; you may use **PM2**. It will also allow you to have BrayanBot persist between reboots, if you configure it that way.
### Using PM2 Process Manager

```bash
# Install PM2 through NPM
sudo npm install -g pm2
# Start BrayanBot with PM2
pm2 start index.js --name brayanbot
```

- `pm2 stop brayanbot` # Stops the pm2 process
- `pm2 restart brayanbot` # Restart the process
- `pm2 logs brayanbot` # View recent logs as well as a live console
- `pm2 logs brayanbot --lines 1000 | nc termbin.com 9999` # Export the bot's past logs and paste them to termbin.
