!!! warning ""
    This page assumes that you have already completed the [Pre-Installation Steps](https://github.com/DakshNamdev/BrayanBot/wiki/Preinstall)
    If you haven not yet completed the pre-installation steps, please go back and complete them because the bot cannot function without them.

## Installation

Clone the source code and move into the bot's directory.

!!! danger "Dev Branch"
    If you are interested in receiving updates *as soon as they are out* for the cost of high chance of breaking changes and less stability; you may clone into the **dev** branch instead of **main**. Changes from the dev branch will be *eventually* merged into main, but it is an option for those who like to live on edge.

=== "Stable"
    1. `git clone https://github.com/DakshNamdev/BrayanBot.git`
    2. `cd BrayanBot`
    3. `copy example.config.yml config.yml`
=== "Dev"
    1. `git clone -b dev https://github.com/DakshNamdev/BrayanBot.git`
    2. `cd BrayanBot`
    3. `copy example.config.yml config.yml`

Install dependencies and start the bot.
=== "NPM"
    1. `npm install`
    2. `npm run start`
=== "Yarn"
    1. `yarn`
    2. `yarn start`

And that's it, you have successfully started your bot!

## Power Controls
If you would like to keep the bot running after you log out of your terminal/machine; you may use **PM2**. It will also allow you to have BrayanBot persist between reboots, if you configure it that way.

### Using PM2 Process Manager

```bash
# Install PM2 through NPM
sudo npm install -g pm2
# Start BrayanBot with PM2
pm2 start index.js --name brayanbot
```

- `pm2 stop brayanbot` # Stops the pm2 process
- `pm2 restart brayanbot` # Restart the process
- `pm2 logs brayanbot` # View recent logs as well as a live console
- `pm2 logs brayanbot --lines 1000 | nc termbin.com 9999` # Export the bot's past logs and paste them to termbin.
