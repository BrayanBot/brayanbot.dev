This page assumes that you have already completed the [Pre-Installation Steps](/docs/setup/pre-installation) If you haven not yet completed the pre-installation steps, please go back and complete them because the bot cannot function without them.

## Installation

### Install Dependencies

To install certain dependencies (like **wget** or the latest version of **curl**) you will need `brew` installed on your machine. However

1. Install brew
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
2. Install wget
```bash
brew install wget
```
3. (Optional) Install curl
If you would like to use `curl` instead of `wget` you may install it using `brew`
```bash
brew install curl
```

### Install BrayanBot
Installing BrayanBot is pretty straightforward and can be done in less than 5 steps.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="stable" label="Stable">

1. Download the zip file and unzip
```bash
wget https://github.com/brayanbotdev/brayanbot/releases/download/latest/brayanbot.zip &
unzip brayanbot.zip
```

unzip brayanbot.zip
```
2. Move into the BrayanBot Directory
```bash
cd BrayanBot
```
3. Copy the example config to the main `config.yml` 
```bash
cp example.config.yml config.yml 
```
**or if you would like to simply rename the file**
```bash
mv example.config.yml config.yml 
```
4. Edit your `config.yml`
```bash
nano config.yml
```
**or**
```bash
vim config.yml # Imagine using vim
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dev" label="Dev">

:::danger Dev Branch
If you are interested in receiving updates *as soon as they are out* for the cost of high chance of breaking changes and less stability; you may clone into the **dev** branch instead of **main**. Changes from the dev branch will be *eventually* merged into main, but it is an option for those who like to live on edge.
You also must keep in mind that using `git` will set up version control for your bot files and will make it harder to update if you have edited default -and tracked- bot files. **Do not** use this branch if you do not know how to use **git**.
:::

1. Clone the Github Repo
```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/BrayanBotDev/BrayanBot.git
```
2. Move into the BrayanBot Directory
```bash
cd BrayanBot
```
3. Copy the example config to the main `config.yml` 
```bash
cp example.config.yml config.yml 
```
**or if you would like to rename the file instead of copying**
```bash
mv example.config.yml config.yml
```
4. Edit your `config.yml`
```bash
nano config.yml
```
**or**
```bash
vim config.yml
```

## Power Controls
If you would like to keep the bot running after you log out of your terminal/machine; you may use **PM2**. It will also allow you to have BrayanBot persist between reboots, if you configure it that way.
### Using PM2 Process Manager

```bash
# Install PM2 through NPM
npm install -g pm2
# Start BrayanBot with PM2
pm2 start index.js --name brayanbot
```

- `pm2 stop brayanbot` # Stops the pm2 process
- `pm2 restart brayanbot` # Restart the process
- `pm2 logs brayanbot` # View recent logs as well as a live console
- `pm2 logs brayanbot --lines 1000 | nc termbin.com 9999` # Export the bot's past logs and paste them to termbin.
